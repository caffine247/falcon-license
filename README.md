# MacOS Falcon sensor customer ID injection
A script to inject customer ID into MacOS Falcon sensor installer.

This is in response to feedback from a blog post I wrote in early 2019: https://www.kevinguay.com/posts/macos-falcon-sensor/

Run using:
`license-falcon.sh /path/to/FalconSensorMacOS.pkg customer_id`
